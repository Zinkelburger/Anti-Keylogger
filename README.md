# Anti-Keylogger
Types random characters. By keeping track of what it typed vs what was typed overall, it can figure out what the user typed. 

## Usage
Open a text editor such as notepad or xed on the right side of your screen. Then hover your mouse over the textbox you'd like to type in. Press `right-ctrl` to start the random characters typing. The text editor on the right side of the screen will quickly fill up with random characters.

Type as you would normally. Once you are done typing, press `right-ctrl` for the program to figure out what you typed. It will type your character into the textbox, and then random characters into the right side of the screen.

## Improvements
I plan on eliminating the need for a text editor to collect the garbage characters, it is very cumbersome.
